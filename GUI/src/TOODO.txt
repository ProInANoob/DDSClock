APP :
 
    GUI:

        make good? 



    STATES:
        ADD LIOOGHT STATES (?) - dont think I need, jsut think about some kinda like transition animation for the arena - like a quick button on thing, 3-2-1. 

        want main press in match to be unstick untill we redo the buttons to have that button. .AH.



    OTEHRFUNCT:
        make sure dead device removes it from the list in systems / gui whatever. oh uh I think id does but test. 
        Make it not segfault when it exits. huh. I dont know why it does this .... its still an issue. 



INOS : 

    - add command reader. - global color var - noo just reset on reception I think..... 
    - add color / state loogic / wriitnjgn. ^^^
    Do CLOCKKKKCKCKCKCKKCKCKCLKLKCKLKCKCKOCOKCOKCCKOOKCOK

Later thing:::
    add devids to all the command messages so I can handle multiple controlers on a network ( or I could just domain it but that hard coded.... )
