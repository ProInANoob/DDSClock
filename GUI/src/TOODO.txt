APP :
 
    GUI:
        ADD MOOAR BUTTONS UNDER CLOCK AND BUTTON LIST. 

        In conntrool button  - add send button coommand open popup fro specs. ( same for clock. )




    STATES:
        ADD LIOOGHT STATES (?)
        ADD SETTING CLOOCK DURATION 
        refoormat tthe system stes into a mapp of [sys, StateStruct]
        sttate Struct : 
            duration
            state var
            settings -> uint32 encoded with defs I gues. 



    OTEHRFUNCT:
        make sure dead device removes it from the list in systems / gui whatever. 



INOS : 

    - refactor to be dual core... do all the reading of dr on one core with the ooother doing button listening / writng / cloock management /  wjaatever.. ( NEED TO DO DDS WORK ON BOTH.... I HTIN K. need some kind of delay thing, dds_work is doing stuff in the meantime so.)
        - nwill probably be nessisary for the clocks.... so ill doo It on  both,,  might not call dds_work in the other core, jusst some other yeild  / wait thing.... I have a  feeling  that dds_work is haveing  issueess,  cvould also be  the  other reader messingg  stufff Illl have to test motre as I buld the code back up ....
    - add data writes - im just gonna add a writte function, do button calling in illinois
    - add command reader. - global color var - noo just reset on reception I think..... 
    - add color / state loogic / wriitnjgn. ^^^
    - see if yoou cann pub devInfoo on new participant, could have listener on devInfo foor role::coonntroll...... 

    - update clock to match progress of buttoon. 
    - have anuva write clock / just steal from the last stuffff.... that wsas kinda jank tho. 

IDL
    ADD ARENA LIGHT ROLE, AND MESSAAGE. 


    MAKE THE BUTTON COMMAND A MORE TARGETED??? JUST TINK ABOUT IS A LITTLE....



okay so the martial thiing seems to happen only in the multithread, could be a dds_work in twwo cores thing,  and 
NEW BUG??? - esp recieves the xyx change but the gui dosent update, no deviceinnfo sent / reciieved or gui bug idk....

... I  cant duplicate it now..... wellll iDK.... could be esp thought it wwas the same name for some reason... and didnt update I hjave no idea...
