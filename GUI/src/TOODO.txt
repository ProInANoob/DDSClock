APP :
 
    GUI:
        ADD MOOAR BUTTONS UNDER CLOCK AND BUTTON LIST. 

        In conntrool button  - add send button coommand open popup fro specs. ( same for clock. )




    STATES:
        ADD LIOOGHT STATES (?)
        ADD SETTING CLOOCK DURATION 
        refoormat tthe system stes into a mapp of [sys, StateStruct] - done I think. 

        want main press in match to be unstick untill we redo the buttons to have that button. 



    OTEHRFUNCT:
        make sure dead device removes it from the list in systems / gui whatever. 
        Make it not segfault when it exits. huh. I dont know why it does this .... 



INOS : 

    - refactor to be dual core... do all the reading of dr on one core with the ooother doing button listening / writng / cloock management /  wjaatever.. ( NEED TO DO DDS WORK ON BOTH.... I HTIN K. need some kind of delay thing, dds_work is doing stuff in the meantime so.)
        - nwill probably be nessisary for the clocks.... so ill doo It on  both,,  might not call dds_work in the other core, jusst some other yeild  / wait thing.... I have a  feeling  that dds_work is haveing  issueess,  cvould also be  the  other reader messingg  stufff Illl have to test motre as I buld the code back up ....

    - add command reader. - global color var - noo just reset on reception I think..... 
    - add color / state loogic / wriitnjgn. ^^^
    - see if yoou cann pub devInfoo on new participant, could have listener on devInfo foor role::coonntroll...... 

    - have anuva write clock / just steal from the last stuffff.... that wsas kinda jank tho. 



Later thing:::
    add devids to all the command messages so I can handle multiple controlers on a network ( or I could just domain it but that hard coded.... )
